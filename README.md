[![Merge to Master Branch](https://github.com/neurowyzr/nw-apollo-dragon-service/actions/workflows/merge-to-master.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/neurowyzr/nw-apollo-dragon-service/actions/workflows/merge-to-master.yml)
# nw-apollo-dragon-service

[This diagram](https://neurowyzr.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TECH/pages/322568194/Dragonfly-Apollo-Service) depicts the how this service integrates with Apollo's and NW's APIs.
 
# Dependencies
- Java 11

# &#127939; Running Locally
Create an _env file_ named `local.env` in the project root path and add the following content:
```
GITHUB_TOKEN
APP_TIMEZONE
CORE_MYSQL_HOST
CORE_MYSQL_PASSWORD
CORS_ORIGIN
CX_COGNIFYX_SVC_HOST
MAGIC_LINK_HOST
MYSQL_HOST
MYSQL_PASSWORD
MY_MYSQL_HOST
MY_MYSQL_PASSWORD
RABBIT_MQ_HOST
RABBIT_MQ_PASSWORD
REPORT_S3_PUBLIC_PATH
NW_API_KEY
GCHAT_ALERT_SPACE
GCHAT_ALERT_TOKEN
API_BASE_URL
API_AUTH_USERNAME
API_AUTH_PASSWORD
S3_AWS_REGION
S3_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
S3_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_S3_BUCKET
```

When executing the service within IntelliJ, use this [plug-in](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7861-envfile) and configure it to load `local.env`.
On the other hand, when running from the terminal, `sbt run` will automatically load that env file.


Make sure you run `docker compose -f cicd/infra-docker-compose.yml -f cicd/infra-docker-compose.pr.yml up -d` to set up docker locally before running `sbt run`


&#128695; Do not commit the env file to the repository.

# Creating User and Test Session

Request
```
POST /v1/patients/{patient-id}/episodes/{episode-id}/test

header:
{
  "x-api-key": "nw_api_key",
  "request-id": "request_id"
}

body:
{
  "uid": "P01234567",
  "ahc_number": "E2345678901",
  "location_id": "10201",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "dob": "1990-12-31",
  "gender": "MALE",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "mobile": 1234567890
}
```

Note: 
- Only `email` and `mobile` are optional fields
- `uid` and `ahc_number` must be equals to `patient-id` and `episode-id` respectively
- `email` should be unique for new users
- `request-id` cannot be duplicate
- Duplicate `episode-id` will return the magic link generated previously
- `location_id` must be valid


### For Apollo's endpoint:  (waiting for Apollo to finalise specs)

Send status and magic link
```
POST /v1/patients/{patient-id}/episodes/{episode-id}/status
```

Upload report
```
POST /v1/patients/{patient-id}/episodes/{episode-id}/report
```

This service wil make HTTP requests to the above endpoints once the respective messages are consumed.

# Message handling
This service listens to 3 types of messages, namely 
- `CreateTestSessionCmd`
- `NotifyClientTaskCmd`
- `UploadCmd`

# &#x1F4DD; Raising a Pull Request
- If it's a _feature_...
  - Checkout `master` branch or get latest from `master` branch.
  - Create a branch named `feature/...` from `master` branch.
- If it's a _hotfix_...
  - Checkout the tag corresponding to the version requiring the fix.
  - Create a branch named `hotfix/...` from the tag checkout.
- Apply your changes in the newly created branch and then commit and push.
- Run suitable tests to ensure that the changes are as expected.
- Create a PR from the created branch (using the `master` branch as the base).
- Merge the PR after getting it reviewed and approved.

# &#x1F680; Releasing a New Version
&#x26A0; Deployment is triggered via release of a new version, and versioning is an essential component of software revision management. Do NOT proceed if you are unable to follow these instructions!

- Ensure that the last [build](https://github.com/neurowyzr/nw-apollo-dragon-service/actions) when _merging to master_ was completed without errors.
- [Publish](https://github.com/neurowyzr/nw-apollo-dragon-service/releases/new) a new release based on below guidelines.
  - Specify a _tag_ for the **next** version as per [semantic versioning](https://semver.org):
      - pre-release - Check the **Set as a pre-release** option and use the tag format `vX.Y.Z-alpha01`.
      - release - Ensure the  **Set as the latest release** option is checked and use the tag format `vX.Y.Z`.
  - Select suitable _target branch_ as follows:
    - the `master` branch when deploying a feature (i.e. a _major_ or _minor_ version).
    - a `hotfix/...` branch when deploying a hotfix (i.e. a _patch_ version).
  - Input a title and information about the release, indicating the version tag and if it's a new feature or a hotfix.
  - Click the **Generate release notes** button.
  - Click the **Save Draft** button and share the draft with your team leader.
  - [Team Leader] Verify the release details, and then click the **Publish Release** button.
- Follow the deployment [progress](https://github.com/neurowyzr/nw-apollo-dragon-service/actions).
- After deployment is complete, verify that the roll-out is successful using the [ping](https://nw-apollo-dragon-service.dev.neurowyzr.com/ping) endpoint.
